# FEATURES
Our version of covey.town incorporates three new features: quick join, avatar selection, and account login and creation. Each of them corresponds to a persona: a novice user, a creative user, and a regular user.

## Quick join feature - novice user
The quick join feature allows novice users to join a room with a single click. It skips the avatar selection, username creation, and town selection. It generates the name “quick user” and an avatar, and it sends the user to the busiest available room. If no rooms are available, the user will be notified so he/she can create one.

If the user selects an avatar and then clicks on quick join, the selected avatar will be displayed.

### To use:

#### 1. Click on ‘quick join’

## Select avatar feature - creative user
Avatar selection allows users who want a more personalized experience to select the character that will be displayed inside the map.

This feature works with a logged-in or guest user.

### To use:

#### 1. Click on the avatar you want to use. The currently selected avatar is signaled by a green outline
#### 2. Join or create a town

## Create account and login - regular user
This feature gives returning users the ability to create an account and login. The account will hold their avatar and username, both of which can be updated.

#### 1. Click the ‘Create Account’ button
#### 2. Enter username and password
#### 3. Repeated usernames are not allowed
#### 4. Click ‘Create’ when ready or ‘Cancel’ to abort

### To login:
